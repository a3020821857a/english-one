## 1
- 法国，自豪地将自己视为全球创新者 (关于时尚),已决定它的时尚产业失去了绝对的权利去定义物理美为女性.<br>France, which prides itself as the global innovator of fashion, has decided its fashion industry has lost an absolute right to define physical beauty for women. 
- 其立法者给予了初步批准(在上周)对一项法律(该法律使之成为一种犯罪对于雇佣超瘦模特在T台上)<br>Its lawmakers gave preliminary approval last week to a law that would make it  a  crime to employ ultra-thin models on runways. 
- 议会还同意禁止网站,即那些煽动过度瘦身(通过推广极端的节食)<br>The parliament also agreed to ban websites that “incite excessive thinness” by promoting extreme dieting. 
## 2
- 这些措施有几个积极的动机。<br>Such measures have a couple of uplifting motives. 
- 它们表明，美丽不应该被定义由外表(结束于妨碍健康)。 <br> They  suggest  beauty  should not be defined by looks that end up  impinging on  health. 
- 这是一个开始<br>That’s a  start. 
- 并且这个禁令(阵对超瘦模特)似乎不仅仅是保护模特,免于把他们自己饿死,正如一些人所做的那样<br>And the ban on ultra-thin models seems to go beyond protecting models  from starving themselves to death – as some have  done.
- 它告诉时尚产业,它必须承担责任对这个信号(传递给女性，尤其是青少年女孩)，关于社会尺度(她们用来衡量他们个人的价值)。<br>It tells the  fashion industry  that  it must take responsibility for the signal it sends women, especially teenage girls, about the social tape-measure they must use to determine their individual worth. 
## 3
- 这些禁令,如果完全执行，将表明向女性(和许多男性),他们不应该让其他人成为仲裁者对于他们的美丽。<br>The bans, if fully enforced, would suggest to women  (and  many  men)  that they should not let others be arbiters of  their beauty. 
- 而且可能微弱地，他们暗示:人们应该关注无形品质像品格和智慧，而不是通过节食的方法去达到零号或蜂腰的身材。<br>And  perhaps faintly, they hint that people should look to intangible qualities like  character  and  intellect  rather than dieting their way to size zero or wasp-waist physiques.
## 4
- 法国的措施,然而,依赖太多于严厉的惩罚, 来改变一个文化(仍视美为肤浅的,和露骨的)。<br>The French measures, however, rely too much on  severe  punishment  to  change a culture that still regards beauty as skin-deep and bone-showing. 
- 根据法律，使用一个时尚模特 (不符合政府定义的指数有关体重)可能导致 85,000 美元的罚款和六个月的监禁。<br>Under the law, using a fashion model that does not meet a government-defined index of  body mass could result in a $85,000 fine and six months in prison. 
## 5
- 时尚产业知道它存在固有的问题在关注物质上的装饰和理想化身材上 。<br>The fashion industry knows it has an inherent  problem  in  focusing  on  material adornment and idealized body  types.
- 在丹麦、美国和一些其他国家，它正在尝试设置自愿的标准为模特和时尚形象(这依赖大多是同行压力来执行)。<br>In  Denmark,  the United  States,  and a few other countries, it is trying to set voluntary standards for models and fashion images that rely more on peer pressure for enforcement. 
## 6
- 相比于法国的行动，丹麦的时尚产业达成一致 (在上个月)制订了规则和制裁对于年龄、健康和其他特征关于模特 。 <br>In contrast to France’s actions, Denmark’s fashion industry agreed last  month  on rules and sanctions regarding the age, health,  and  other  characteristics  of models.
- 新修订的丹麦时尚道德宪章明确表示：“我们意识到并承担责任对这种影响 (时尚产业已经施加在身体理想上的，尤其是对年轻人的) 。<br> The newly revised Danish Fashion Ethical Charter clearly states: “We are aware of and take responsibility for the impact the fashion industry has on body ideals, especially on young people.” 
- 宪章的主要工具用于执行的是拒绝参与对于那些设计师和模特机构去哥本哈根时装周（CFW） (组织于丹麦时尚学院)。<br>The charter’s main tool of enforcement is to  deny access for designers and modeling agencies to Copenhagen Fashion Week (CFW), which is run by the Danish Fashion Institute. 
- 但总的来说，它依赖公开指责的方法关于遵守。<br>But in general it relies on a name-and-shame method of compliance.”  
## 7
- 依赖道德劝说而不是法律来解决滥用 (关于身体理想) 可能是最好的一步。<br>Relying on ethical persuasion rather than law to address the misuse of body ideals may be the best step. 
- 甚至更好的是去帮助提升观念关于美丽 ，超越物质上的标准于这个特定的行业。<br>Even better would be to help elevate notions of beauty beyond the material standards of a particular industry.

- 展示了很少的担心对健康因素 <br>[C] showing little concern for health factors.

# text2 英国乡村亟待各派政治力量联合起来加以保护
## 1
- 首次在历史上，更多的人居住在城镇超过了乡村。<br>For the first time in history more people live in towns than in the country.
- 在英国，这产生了一个奇怪的结果。<br> In Britain this has had a curious result.
- 尽管民意调查显示，英国人视“乡村”与王室、莎士比亚和国家医疗服务（NHS）作为使他们为之自豪的东西在他们国家,但这仅得到了有限的政治支持。<br>While polls show Britons rate “the countryside” alongside the royal family, Shakespeare and the National Health Service (NHS) as what makes them proudest of their country, this has limited political support.  
## 2
- 一个世纪前，奥克塔维亚·希尔创立了国家信托组织,不是为了拯救时尚的房屋,而是为了保存美(自然地方)为所有人永远地<br>A century ago Octavia Hill launched the National Trust not to rescue stylish houses but to save “the beauty of natural places for everyone forever.” 
- 这是专门提供给城市居民空间用来休闲,在那里他们可以体验到“清新的空气"<br>It was specifically to provide city dwellers with spaces for leisure where they could experience “a refreshing air.” 
- 希尔的施压后来导致了其创建(即国家公园和绿化带)。<br>Hill’s pressure later led to the creation of national  parks and green belts. 
- 他们不再制造乡村，并且每年混凝土都在消耗更多的乡村。 <br>They don’t make countryside any more, and every year concrete consumes more of it.
-  这需要持续的守护。 <br> It needs constant guardianship.
## 3
- 在下一次选举中，没有一个大党似乎可能赞同这种观点。<br>At the next election none of the big parties seem likely to endorse  this  sentiment. 
- 保守党的规划改革明确地给出农村的发展优先于保护,甚至授权“计划外”的建设在当地的人可能反对的情况下<br>The Conservatives’ planning reform explicitly gives rural development priority over conservation, even authorising  “off-plan”  building  where  local people might object. 
- 这个概念 (关于可持续发展) 已经被定义为盈利的。 <br>The concept of sustainable development has been defined as profitable. 
- 工党同样地想停止当地方政府反对发展时的地方规划。工党同样地希望取消地方规划(在议会反对发展的地方)<br>Labour likewise wants to discontinue local planning where councils  oppose development. 
- 自由民主党是沉默的。<br>The Liberal Democrats are silent. 
- 只有英国独立党(Ukip),感觉到它的机会，站在了那些人一边(即呼吁采取更深思熟虑的方法去使用绿色土地的人)。<br>Only Ukip, sensing its  chance, has sided with those pleading for a more  considered  approach  to  using green land.
- 它的运动(保护乡村在英国) 造成恐惧给许多地方保守党派 。<br> Its Campaign to Protect Rural England struck terror into many local Conservative parties. 
## 4
- 合理地点去建造新房屋、工厂和办公室是在人们所在的地方,即在城市和城镇(那些基础设施已经在哪)。<br>The sensible place to build new houses, factories and offices is where  people are, in cities and towns where infrastructure is  in  place. 
- 伦敦的代理公司Stirling Ackroyd最近确定了足够的地块为建造五十万套房屋在伦敦地区(单独地),而没有任何侵犯对绿色地带<br>The  London  agents Stirling Ackroyd recently identified enough sites for half a million houses in the London area alone, with no intrusion on green belt. 
- 实际情况在伦敦的也是实际情况在其他省份的。<br>What is true  of  London is  even truer of the provinces. 
## 5
- 观点 “住房危机” 等同于 “混凝土制的草地” 是纯粹的游说言论。<br>The idea that “housing crisis” equals “concreted meadows” is pure lobby talk. 
- 问题不是这种需要对更多的房屋，而是如既往一样，在于放它们在哪里。<br>The issue is not the need for more houses but, as always, where to put them. 
- 在游行压力下，乔治·奥斯本偏爱农村新建而非城市的翻新和复兴。 <br>Under lobby pressure, George Osborne favours rural new-build against urban renovation  and  renewal.  
- 他偏爱城外购物场所而非高级商业街。 这<br>He favours out-of-town shopping sites  against high  streets.

- 他们这样做得最好,建筑位置保持在他们的边缘并且尊重他们的特征<br>They do so best where building sticks  to  their  edges  and  respects their character. 
- 我们没有破坏城市保护区。 为何要破坏农村的呢？<br>We do not ruin urban conservation areas. Why ruin rural ones? 
## 6
- 发展应该是被计划的，而不是任其发展。<br>Development should be planned, not let rip. 
- 在荷兰之后，英国是欧洲最拥挤的国家。<br>After the Netherlands, Britain is Europe’s most crowded country. 
- 半个世纪的城镇和乡村规划使它能够保留令人羡慕的农村的一致性，同时仍允许低密度的城市生活。<br>Half a century of town and country planning has enabled it to retain an enviable rural coherence, while still permitting low-density urban living. 
- 这没有疑问关于另一可替换的路 ——被毁掉的风景地貌在南葡萄牙、西班牙或爱尔兰的。<br>There is no doubt of the alternative – the corrupted landscapes of southern Portugal, Spain or Ireland. 
- 避免而非促进这种情况应该是联合左翼和右翼在政治光谱上。<br>Avoiding this rather than promoting it should unite the left and right of the political spectrum.

# text3 光环效应：行善政策能在企业被诉时有所助益
## 1
- “唯一且只有一个的社会责任对于企业，” 写自米尔顿·弗里德曼,诺贝尔奖获奖经济学家,"那就是利用其资源并从事活动,旨在增加其利润"<br>“There is one and only one social responsibility of business,” wrote Milton Friedman, a Nobel prize-winning economist, “That is, to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits.” 
- 但即使你接受弗里德曼的前提并视企业社会责任（CSR）政策为一种浪费对于股东的金钱，事情可能并不是绝对地一刀切。<br>But even if you accept Friedman’s premise and regard corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies as a waste of shareholders’ money, things may not be absolutely clear-cut. 
- 新的研究表明，CSR 可能创造货币价值为公司 —— 至少 (在他们被起诉因为腐败时)是这样。<br> New research suggests that CSR may create monetary value for  companies  – at  least when they are prosecuted for corruption. 
## 2
- 这些最大的公司位于美国和英国花费超过 150 亿美元每年在CSR上,根据一项估计由EPG,一家咨询公司.<br>The largest firms in America and Britain together spend more  than $15 billion   a year on CSR, according to an estimate by  EPG,  a consulting firm.
- 这可以增加价值为他们的企业通过这三种方式 。<br>This could  add value to their businesses in three ways. 
- 首先，消费者可能将 CSR 开支视为一种 “信号”，表明一个公司产品是高质量的。<br>First, consumers may  take  CSR  spending as a “signal” that a company’s products are of high quality.
- 第二，顾客可能愿意购买一个公司的产品 ,作为一种间接方式去捐赠给这种好事业由于它曾帮助过。 <br> Second, customers may be willing to buy a company’s products as  an  indirect  way  to  donate to the good causes it helps. 
- 第三，通过更广泛的 “光环效应”，即其善行为其赢得了更多的体谅来自消费者和其他人 。<br>And third, through a more diffuse “halo effect,” whereby its good deeds earn it greater consideration from consumers and others. 
## 3
- 以前的研究 (关于企业社会责任（CSR）)遇到了困难 (在区分这些影响方面)<br>Previous studies on CSR have had  trouble differentiating  these effects  because consumers can be affected by all three. 
- 一项最近的研究试图区分它们通过研究贿赂起诉在美国的《海外腐败行为法案》（FCPA）下。 <br>A recent study attempts  to  separate them by looking at bribery prosecutions under America’s  Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).
- 它认为，由于检察官不会消费一个公司的产品作为一部分关于他们的调查 ，他们受影响仅被光环效应 。<br>It argues that since prosecutors do not consume a company’s products as part of their investigations, they  could  be  influenced  only by the halo effect.
## 4
- 这项研究发现，在被起诉的公司中，那些拥有最全面的CSR 划的公司倾向于得到更温和的惩罚。<br>The study found that, among prosecuted firms, those with the most comprehensive CSR programmes tended to get more lenient penalties. 
- that accounted for the leniency: <br>他们的分析排除了这种可能性：是公司的政治影响力，而不是他们的 CSR 立场，造成了这种宽大处理<br>Their analysis ruled out the possibility that it was firms’ political influence, rather than  their CSR stand, 
-  did not receive lower fines. <br>公司 (贡献更多对政治活动) 没有收到更低的罚款。<br>Companies that contributed more  to political campaigns
## 5
- whereas prosecutors should  only  evaluate  a case based on its merits,<br> they do seem to be influenced by a company’s record in CSR. <br>总的来说,一项研究总结:尽管检察官应该仅评估一个案例仅基于它的本身特征, 但是他们似乎被影响了由一个公司的记录(在CSR)<br>In all, the study concludes that 
- “我们估计，无论是消除一个重大的劳工权利权纠纷，如童工，还是增加企业捐赠大约 20%，通常会降低 40% 相比典型的惩罚对于贿赂外国官员”，说于一位研究员。<br>“We estimate that either eliminating a substantial  labour-rights  concern, such as child labour, or increasing corporate giving by about 20% results  in fines  that generally are 40% lower than the typical punishment for bribing foreign officials,” says one researcher.
## 6
- 研究人员承认，他们的研究并未解答这个问题(即企业应该花费多少在CSR上)。<br>Researchers admit that their study does not answer the question of how much businesses ought to spend on CSR. 
- 它也未能揭示出企业能多大程度指望光环效应,而不是其他可能的益处,当公司决定其善行政策时。 <br>Nor does it reveal how much companies are banking on the halo effect, rather than the  other  possible  benefits,  when  they decide their do-gooding policies. 
- 但至少他们已经证明，当公司有麻烦在法律上时,证据关于良好的品格可以为他们赢得较低成本的惩罚。<br>But at least they have demonstrated that when companies get  into trouble with the law, evidence of good character can win them a less costly punishment.


## 选项
- 作者看待米尔顿·弗里德曼的陈述关于 CSR 是哪种态度<br>The author views Milton Friedman’s statement about CSR with
- 宽容<br>[A] tolerance.
- 怀疑<br>[B] skepticism.
- 赞同<br>[C] approval.
- 不确定<br>[D] uncertainty.

- 根据第二段，CSR 帮助一家公司通过<br>According to Paragraph 2, CSR helps a company by
- 防范它做出不法行为<br>[A] guarding it against malpractices.
- 保护它远离被诽谤<br>[B] protecting it from being defamed.
- 赢得了信任来自消费者<br>[C] winning trust from consumers.
- 提高了质量关于产品<br>[D] raising the quality of its products.

- 这个表达 “more lenient”（第4段）最接近的意思是<br>The expression “more lenient” (Para.4) is closest in meaning to
- 不太有争议的<br>[A] less controversial.
- 更有效的<br>[B] more effective.
- 更持久的<br>[C] more lasting.
- 不那么严厉的<br>[D] less severe.

- 当检察官评估一个案件时，一家公司的 CSR 记录<br>When prosecutors evaluate a case, a company’s CSR record
-  有一个影响对他们的决定<br>[A] has an impact on their decision.
- 被视为可靠的证据<br>[B] comes across as reliable evidence.
- 增加机率关于被惩罚<br>[C] increases the chance of being penalized.
- 构成其中一部分关于调查<br>[D] constitutes part of the investigation.

- 它的负面影响 (对企业的) 经常被忽视<br>[A] Its negative effects on businesses are often overlooked.
- 必要的数额关于公司花费在它上的是未知的<br>[B] The necessary amount of companies’ spending on it is unknown.
- 公司的财务能力 (对它而言) 是被高估<br>[C] Companies’ financial capacity for it has been overestimated.
- 它带来了很多好处为银行业 <br>[D] It has brought much benefit to the banking industry.
# text4 让纸质版报纸成为一种奢移品
## 1
- 最终会迎来一天，《纽约时报》停止在发表新闻在新闻纸刊上。  <br>There will eventually come a day when The New York Times ceases to publish stories on newsprint.
- 确切是哪一天尚有问题在争议。<br>Exactly when that day will be is a matter of debate.
-  “可能是某个时候在未来”，该报的出版商曾说在 2010 年 。<br> “Sometime in the future,” the paper’s publisher said back in 2010.
## 2
- 撇开对墨水于纸上和沙沙声的纸页到一边 ，也有足够多的动机去放弃纸质报纸 。<br>Nostalgia for ink on paper and the rustle of pages aside, there’s plenty of incentive to ditch print. 
- 基础设施被要求于制作实体报纸 —— 印刷机、运输卡车 —— 不仅是昂贵,而且它是繁杂的在当今时代(当仅线上的竞争对手没有同样问题在财务限制上)。 <br>The infrastructure required to make a physical newspaper– printing presses, delivery trucks – isn’t just expensive; it’s excessive at a time when online-only competitors don’t have the same set of financial constraints. 
- 读者正远离纸质报纸。 <br>Readers are migrating away from print anyway. 
- 虽然纸质广告销售仍远高于其在线和移动对应版本，但纸质版本的收入仍在下降。尽管印刷广告销售额仍然远超其线上和移动广告的对应情况,但是其营收来自纸质广告仍在下降<br>And though print ad sales still dwarf their online and mobile counterparts, revenue from print is still declining. 
## 3
- 虽然运营成本高昂且发行量减少，但急于去取消其纸质版本将是一个错误,BuzzFeed 首席执行官乔纳·佩雷蒂说<br>Overhead may be high and circulation lower, but rushing to eliminate its print edition would be a mistake, says BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti.
## 4
- 佩雷蒂说，《纽约时报》不应该浪费时间脱离纸质报业，但前提是他们做这件事以正确的方式。<br>Peretti says the Times shouldn’t waste time getting out of the print  business,  but only if they go about doing it the right way.
- 他表示，“找到加速这一过渡的方式对他们来说是有意义的，但如果你停止它，你将使你最忠诚的客户对你非常不满。”"找到一个方式去加速这一转变是有意义的对他们",他说,"但如果你不继续它,你将使你最忠诚的客户感到非常不满对你<br>“Figuring out a way to accelerate that transition would make sense for them,” he said, “but if you discontinue it, you’re going to have your most loyal customers really upset with you.” 
## 5
- 有时候，是值得做出改变的。 佩雷蒂举例了(Netflix 没有继续它的 DVD 邮寄服务以专注流媒体)。 <br>Sometimes that’s worth making  a change  anyway. Peretti  gives  the  example of Netflix discontinuing its DVD-mailing service to focus on streaming. 
- 这被视为一个失误，”他说。 <br> “It  was  seen as a blunder,” he said.
- 但这一举措实际上是颇有远见的。<br> The move turned out to be  foresighted. 
- “ 如果佩雷蒂是负责《纽约时报》呢？ “我不会选定一个年份中止纸质版本，”他说。<br>And if Peretti were in charge at the Times? “I wouldn’t pick a year to  end  print,” he  said. 
- “我会提高价格，并使它成为更多的一种遗产产品。”<br> “I  would raise prices and make it into more of a legacy product.” 
## 6
- 这个想法是，最忠诚的客户仍然可以获得他们喜爱的产品，他们会感觉自己正在帮助维持他们相信的东西的质量。最忠实的客户仍然会得到这种产品(他们喜欢的),这一理念认为，他们会感觉像是他们在帮助维持其质量关于这些东西(他们所信仰的)<br>The most loyal customers would still get the product they favor, the idea goes, and they’d feel like they were helping sustain  the  quality  of  something  they  believe in. 
- “所以，如果你为支付过多为纸质版本，你也会感觉像是你正在帮助，”佩雷蒂说。<br>“So if you’re overpaying for print, you could feel like  you  were  helping,” Peretti said. 
- “然后增加价格以更高的比率每年，从本质上尝试去产生额外营收。” <br>“Then increase it at a higher rate  each  year  and  essentially try to generate additional revenue.” 
- 换句话说，如果你要去制作纸质产品，就制作它为那些人(那些已经痴迷于它的人) 制作。 <br>In other words, if you’re going to make a print product, make it for the people who are already obsessed with  it. 
- 这可能是《纽约时报》在做的事情了已经。<br>Which  may be  what the Times is doing already. 
- 获取纸质版本七天一周花费接近 500 美元一年 —— 是两倍多对比仅数字订阅. <br>Getting the print edition seven days a week costs nearly $500 a year – more than twice as much as a digital-only subscription.
## 7
- “这是一件非常困难的事情去做到，它是一个巨大的奢侈品,即 BuzzFeed 没有一个遗产生意，”佩雷蒂评论说。<br>“It’s a really hard thing to do and it’s a tremendous luxury that BuzzFeed doesn’t have a legacy business,” Peretti remarked.
- “但当时，我们也将面临问题像这些事情(我们正在做的)可能没有意义在市场变化和世界变化时.。<br> “But we’re going to have  questions like that where we have things we’re doing that don’t make sense when   the market changes and the world changes.
- 在这些情况下，它会更好去采取更主动的而不是较被动的策略 。”<br> In those situations,  it’s  better  to  be more aggressive than less aggressive.” 

## 选项
- 纽约时报正在考虑终结其打印版本部分是由于<br>The New York Times is considering ending its print edition partly due to
- 高成本的运营<br>[A] the high cost of operation.
- 增加的线上广告销售 <br>[B] the increasing online ad sales.
-  这种压力来自它的投资者<br>[C] the pressure from its investors.
- 投诉来自它的读者<br>[D] the complaints from its readers.

- Peretti 建议，面对目前的情况，纽约时报应该<br>Peretti suggests that, in face of the present situation, the Times should
- 结束印刷版本彻底地<br>[A] end the print edition for good.
- 做出战略性的调整<br>[B] make strategic adjustments.
- 寻找新来源关于读者<br>[C] seek new sources of readership.
- 目标是高效的管理<br>[D] aim for efficient management.

- 这可以推断出 (从第5和6段)  “一个遗产产品”<br>It can be inferred from Paragraphs 5 and 6 that a “legacy product”
- 有助于恢复荣耀(以往时候的)<br>[A] helps restore the glory of former times.
- 是准备给最忠诚的客户 <br>[B] is meant for the most loyal customers.
- 使成本(关于打印) 降低<br>[C] will have the cost of printing reduced.
- 扩大了其受欢迎度关于报纸<br>[D] expands the popularity of the paper.

- Peretti 认为，在一个不断变化的世界中，<br>Peretti believes that, in a changing world,
- 传统的奢侈品可以保持不受影响<br>[A] traditional luxuries can stay unaffected.
- 谨慎促进解决问题<br>[B] cautiousness facilitates problem-solving.
- 积极性更好地应对挑战<br>[C] aggressiveness better meets challenges.
- 遗产企业正在变得过时<br>[D] legacy businesses are becoming outdated.

- 以下哪个是最好的标题对于这篇文章 ？<br>Which of the following would be the best title of the text?
- 转向在线报纸 (一次性地)<br>[A] Shift to Online Newspapers All at Once
